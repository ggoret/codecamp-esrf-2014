<p>Before diving into the core tutorial, it is important to understand that OpenGL
has evolved over the years and a big change occured in 2003 with the
introduction of the dynamic pipeline (OpenGL 2.0), i.e. the use of shaders that
allow to have direct access to the GPU.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">ES is a light version of OpenGL for embedded systems such as tablets or
mobiles. There also exists WebGL which is very similar to ES but is not shown on
this graphic.</p>

<p>Before this version, OpenGL was using a fixed pipeline and you may still find a
lot of tutorials that still use this fixed pipeline. How to know if a tutorial
address the fixed pipeline ? It's relatively easy.  If you see GL commands such
as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
glVertex, glColor, glLight, glMaterial
glBegin, glEnd
glMatrix, glMatrixMode, glLoadIdentity
glPushMatrix, glPopMatrix
glRect, glPolygonMode
glBitmap, glAphaFunc
glNewList, glDisplayList
glPushAttrib, glPopAttrib
glVertexPointer, glColorPointer, glTexCoordPointer, glNormalPointer
</pre>
<p>then it's most certainly a tutorial that adress the fixed pipeline.
While modern OpenGL is far more powerful than the fixed pipeline version, the
learning curve may be a bit steeper. This tutorial will try to help you start
using it.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-are-shaders">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">What are shaders ?</a></h2>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The shader language is called glsl.  There are many versions that goes from 1.0
to 1.5 and subsequents version get the number of OpenGL version. Last version
is 4.4 (February 2014).</p>
</div>
<p>Shaders are pieces of program (using a C-like language) that are build onto the
GPU and executed during the rendering pipeline. Depending on the nature of the
shaders (there are many types depending on the version of OpenGL you're using),
they will act at different stage of the rendering pipeline. To simplify this
tutorial, we'll use only <strong>vertex</strong> and <strong>fragment</strong> shader as shown below:</p>
<img alt="images/gl-pipeline.png" src="images/gl-pipeline.png" style="width: 75%;" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>A vertex shader acts on vertices and is supposed to output the vertex
<strong>position</strong> (→ <tt class="docutils literal">gl_Position</tt>) on the viewport (i.e. screen). A fragment shader
acts at the fragment level and is supposed to output the <strong>color</strong>
(→ <tt class="docutils literal">gl_FragColor</tt>) of the fragment. Hence, a minimal vertex shader is:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0);
}
</pre>
<p>while a minimal fragment shader would be:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void main()
{
    gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0);
}
</pre>
<p>These two shaders are not very useful since the first will transform any
vertex into the null vertex while the second will output the black color for
any fragment. We'll see later how to make them to do more useful things.</p>
<p>One question remains: when are those shaders exectuted exactly ? The vertex
shader is executed for each vertex that is given to the rendering pipeline
(we'll see what does that mean exactly later) and the fragment shader is
executed on each fragment that is generated after the vertex stage. For
example, in the simple figure above, the vertex would be called 3 times, once
for each vertex (1,2 and 3) while the fragment shader would be executed 21
times, once for each fragment (pixel).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-buffers">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">What are buffers ?</a></h2>
<p>We explained earlier that the vertex shader act on the vertices. The question
is thus where do those vertices comes from ? The idea of modern GL is that
vertices are stored on the GPU and needs to be uploaded (only once) to the GPU
before rendering. The way to do that is to build buffers onto the CPU and to
send them onto the GPU. If your data does not change, no need to upload it
again. That is the big difference with the previous fixed pipeline where data
were uploaded at each rendering call (only display lists were built into GPU
memory).</p>
<p>But what is the structure of a vertex ? OpenGL does not assume anything about
your vertex structure and you're free to use as many information you may need
for each vertex. The only condition is that all vertices from a buffer have the
same structure (possibly with different content). This again is a big
difference with the fixed pipeline where OpenGL was doing a lot of complex
rendering stuff for you (projections, lighting, normals, etc.) with an implicit
fixed vertex structure. Now you're on your own...</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Good news</strong> is that you're now free to do virtually anything you want.</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Bad news</strong> is that you have to program everything, even the most basic things like projection and lighting.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Let's take a simple example of a vertex structure where we want each vertex to
hold a position and a color. The easiest way to do that in python is to use a
structured array using the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.numpy.org">numpy</a> library:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
data = numpy.zeros(4, dtype = [ (&quot;position&quot;, np.float32, 3),
                                (&quot;color&quot;,    np.float32, 4)] )
</pre>
<p>We just created a CPU buffer with 4 vertices, each of them having a
<tt class="docutils literal">position</tt> (3 floats for x,y,z coordinates) and a <tt class="docutils literal">color</tt> (4 floats for
red, blue, green and alpha channels). Note that we explicitely chose to have 3
coordinates for <tt class="docutils literal">position</tt> but we may have chosen to have only 2 if were to
work in two-dimensions only. Same holds true for <tt class="docutils literal">color</tt>. We could have used
only 3 channels (r,g,b) if we did not want to use transparency. This would save
some bytes for each vertex. Of course, for 4 vertices, this does not really
matter but you have to realize it <strong>will matter</strong> if you data size grows up to
one or ten million vertices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-uniforms-attributes-and-varyings">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">What are uniforms, attributes and varyings ?</a></h2>
<p>At this point in the tutorial, we know what are shaders and buffers but we
still need to explain how they may be connected together. So, let's consider
again our CPU buffer:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
data = numpy.zeros(4, dtype = [ (&quot;position&quot;, np.float32, 2),
                                (&quot;color&quot;,    np.float32, 4)] )
</pre>
<p>We need to tell the vertex shader that it will have to handle vertices where a
position is a tuple of 3 floats and color is a tuple of 4 floats. This is
precisely what attributes are meant for. Let us change slightly our previous
vertex shader:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
attribute vec2 position;
attribute vec4 color;
void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
}
</pre>
<p>This vertex shader now expects a vertex to possess 2 attributes, one named
<tt class="docutils literal">position</tt> and one named <tt class="docutils literal">color</tt> with specified types (vec3 means tuple of
3 floats and vec4 means tuple of 4 floats). It is important to note that even
if we labeled the first attribute <tt class="docutils literal">position</tt>, this attribute is not yet bound
to the actual <tt class="docutils literal">position</tt> in the numpy array. We'll need to do it explicitly
at some point in our program and there is no automagic that will bind the numpy
array field to the right attribute, you'll have to do it yourself, but we'll
see that later.</p>
<p>The second type of information we can feed the vertex shader are the uniforms
that may be considered as constant values (across all the vertices). Let's say
for example we want to scale all the vertices by a constant factor <tt class="docutils literal">scale</tt>,
we would thus write:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform float scale;
attribute vec2 position;
attribute vec4 color;
void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(position*scale, 0.0, 1.0);
}
</pre>
<p>Last type is the varying type that is used to pass information between the
vertex stage and the fragment stage. So let us suppose (again) we want to pass
the vertex color to the fragment shader, we now write:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform float scale;
attribute vec2 position;
attribute vec4 color;
varying vec4 v_color;

void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(position*scale, 0.0, 1.0);
    v_color = color;
}
</pre>
<p>and then in the fragment shader, we write:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
varying vec4 v_color;

void main()
{
    gl_FragColor = v_color;
}
</pre>
<p>The question is what is the value of <tt class="docutils literal">v_color</tt> inside the fragment shader ?
If you look at the figure that introduced the gl pipleline, we have 3 vertices and 21
fragments. What is the color of each individual fragment ?</p>
<p>The answer is <em>the interpolation of all 3 vertices color</em>. This interpolation
is made using distance of the fragment to each individual vertex. This is a
very important concept to understand. Any varying value is interpolated between
the vertices that compose the elementary item (mostly, line or triangle).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Summary</a></h2>
<p>We're done with this part. We know we need a structured numpy array to hold our
vertices, a vertex shader to instruct the GPU what to do with the vertices and
a fragment shader to compute the final color. Now comes the hard part where
we'll put all this together...</p>

<div class="section" id="hello-flat-world">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Hello (flat) world!</a></h1>
<p>Before using OpenGL, we need to open a window with a valid GL context. This can
be done using toolkit such as Gtk, Qt or Wx or any native toolkit (Windows,
Linux, OSX). Note there also exists dedicated toolkits such as GLFW or GLUT and
the advantage of GLUT is that it's already installed alongside OpenGL. Even if
it is now deprecated, we'll use GLUT since it's a very lightweight toolkit and
does not require any extra package. Here is a minimal setup that should open a
window with garbage on it (since we do not even clear the window):</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">GLUT is now deprecated and you might prefer to use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.glfw.org">GLFW</a>
which is actively maintained.</p>
</div>
<pre class="literal-block">
import OpenGL.GL as gl
import OpenGL.GLUT as glut

def display():
    glut.glutSwapBuffers()

def reshape(width,height):
    gl.glViewport(0, 0, width, height)

def keyboard( key, x, y ):
    if key == '\033':
        sys.exit( )

glut.glutInit()
glut.glutInitDisplayMode(glut.GLUT_DOUBLE | glut.GLUT_RGBA)
glut.glutCreateWindow('Hello world!')
glut.glutReshapeWindow(512,512)
glut.glutReshapeFunc(reshape)
glut.glutDisplayFunc(display)
glut.glutKeyboardFunc(keyboard)
glut.glutMainLoop()
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">glutInitDisplayMode</tt> tells OpenGL what are the context properties. At
this stage, we only need a swap buffer (we draw on one buffer while the other
is displayed) and we use a full RGBA 32 bits color buffer (8 bits per
channel).</p>
<p>Let's consider again some data (in 2 dimensions):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
data = numpy.zeros(4, dtype = [ (&quot;position&quot;, np.float32, 2),
                                (&quot;color&quot;,    np.float32, 4)] )

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">The hard way (OpenGL)</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="building-the-program">
<h3>Building the program</h3>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last"><tt class="docutils literal">vertex_code</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">fragment_code</tt> correspond to the vertex and fragment shaders
code as shown above.</p>
</div>
<p>Building the program is relatively straightforward provided we do not
check for errors. First we need to request program and shader slots from GPU:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
program  = gl.glCreateProgram()
vertex   = gl.glCreateShader(gl.GL_VERTEX_SHADER)
fragment = gl.glCreateShader(gl.GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER)
</pre>
<p>Then we can compile shaders into GPU objects:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# Set shaders source
gl.glShaderSource(vertex, vertex_code)
gl.glShaderSource(fragment, fragment_code)

# Compile shaders
gl.glCompileShader(vertex)
gl.glCompileShader(fragment)
</pre>
<p>We can now build and link the program:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gl.glAttachShader(program, vertex)
gl.glAttachShader(program, fragment)
gl.glLinkProgram(program)
</pre>
<p>We can not get rid of shaders, they won't be used again:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gl.glDetachShader(program, vertex)
gl.glDetachShader(program, fragment)
</pre>
<p>Finally, we make program the default program to be ran. We can do it now
because we'll use a single in this example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gl.glUseProgram(program)
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="building-the-buffer">
<h3>Building the buffer</h3>
<p>Building the buffer is even simpler:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# Request a buffer slot from GPU
buffer = gl.glGenBuffers(1)

# Make this buffer the default one
gl.glBindBuffer(gl.GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer)

# Upload data
gl.glBufferData(gl.GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, data.nbytes, data, gl.GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW)
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="binding-the-buffer-to-the-program">
<h3>Binding the buffer to the program</h3>
<p>Binding the buffer to the program needs some work and computations. We need to
tell the GPU how to read the buffer and bind each value to the relevant
attribute. To do this, GPU needs to kow what is the stride between 2
consecutive element and what is the offset to read one attribute:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
stride = data.strides[0]

offset = ctypes.c_void_p(0)
loc = gl.glGetAttribLocation(program, &quot;position&quot;)
gl.glEnableVertexAttribArray(loc)
gl.glBindBuffer(gl.GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer)
gl.glVertexAttribPointer(loc, 3, gl.GL_FLOAT, False, stride, offset)

offset = ctypes.c_void_p(data.dtype[&quot;position&quot;].itemsize)
loc = gl.glGetAttribLocation(program, &quot;color&quot;)
gl.glEnableVertexAttribArray(loc)
gl.glBindBuffer(gl.GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer)
gl.glVertexAttribPointer(loc, 4, gl.GL_FLOAT, False, stride, offset)
</pre>
<p>Here we're basically telling the program how to bind data to the relevant
attribute. This is made by providing the stride of the array (how many bytes
between each record) and the offset of a given attribute.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="binding-the-uniform">
<h3>Binding the uniform</h3>
<p>Binding the uniform is much more simpler. We request the location of the
uniform and we upload the value using the dedicated function to upload one
float only:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
loc = gl.glGetUniformLocation(program, &quot;scale&quot;)
gl.glUniform1f(loc, 1.0)
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="choosing-primitives">
<h3>Choosing primitives</h3>
<p>Before rendering, we need to tell OpenGL what to do with our vertices,
i.e. what does these vertices describe in term of geometrical primitives.
This is quite an important parameter since this determines how many fragments
will be actually generated by the shape as illustrated on the image below:</p>
<img alt="images/gl-primitives.png" src="images/gl-primitives.png" style="width: 75%;" />
<p>There exist other primitives but we won't used them during this tutorial (and
they're mainly related to <em>geometry shaders</em> that are not introduced in this
tutorial). Since we want do display a square, we can use 2 triangles to make a
square and thus we'll use a <tt class="docutils literal">GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP</tt> primitive. We'll see later
how to make more complex shapes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-data">
<h3>Setting data</h3>
<p>We're almost ready to render something but let's first fill some values:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
data['color']    = [ (1,0,0,1), (0,1,0,1), (0,0,1,1), (1,1,0,1) ]
data['position'] = [ (-1,-1),   (-1,+1),   (+1,-1),   (+1,+1)   ]
</pre>
<p>If the color field makes sense (normalized RGBA values), why do we use
coordinates such as (-1,-1) for vertex position ? We know the windows size is
512x512 pixels in our case, so why not use (0,0) or (512,512) instead ?</p>
<p>At this point in the tutorial, OpenGL does not really care of the actual size
of the window (also called viewport) in terms of pixels. If you look at the
GLUT code above, you may have noticed this line:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def reshape(width,height):
    gl.glViewport(0, 0, width, height)
</pre>
<p>This function is called whenever the window is resized and the <tt class="docutils literal">glViewport</tt>
call does two things. It instructs OpenGL of the current window size and it
setup an implicit <em>normalized</em> coordinate system that goes from (-1,-1) (for the
bottom-left corner) to (+1,+1) to top-right corner. Thus, our vertices position
cover the whole window.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rendering">
<h3>Rendering</h3>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="scripts/hello-world-gl.py"><img alt="images/hello-world.png" class="align-right" src="images/hello-world.png" style="width: 15%;" /></a>
<p>Ok, we're done, we can now rewrite the display function as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def display():
    gl.glClear(gl.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
    gl.glDrawArrays(gl.GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, 0, 4)
    glut.glutSwapBuffers()
</pre>
<p>The 0, 4 arguments in the <tt class="docutils literal">glDrawArrays</tt> tells OpenGL we want to display 4
vertices from our array and we start at vertex 0.</p>
<p>Click on the image on the right to get the source.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-easy-way-gloo">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">The easy way (gloo)</a></h2>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="scripts/hello-world-gloo.py"><img alt="images/hello-world.png" class="align-right" src="images/hello-world.png" style="width: 15%;" /></a>
<p>Since the above method is quite cumbersome, we'll now use the gloo interface.
Now, we can just write:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
program = gloo.Program(vertex, fragment, count=4)
program['color']    = [ (1,0,0,1), (0,1,0,1), (0,0,1,1), (1,1,0,1) ]
program['position'] = [ (-1,-1),   (-1,+1),   (+1,-1),   (+1,+1)   ]
program['scale']    = 1.0
</pre>
<p>Gloo takes care of building the buffer because we specified the vertex count
value and will also bind the relevant attributes and uniforms to the
program provided. To render the scene, we can now write:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
program.draw(gl.GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP)
</pre>
<p>Click on the image on the right to get the source.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-step-further">

<p>The nice thing with gloo is that it takes care of any change in uniform or
attribute values. If you change them through the program interface, these
values will be updated on the GPU just-in-time. So, let's have some animation

<p>We need first to define what do we want to view, that is, we need to define a
viewing volume such that any object within the volume (even partially) will be
rendered while objects outside won't. On the image below, the yellow and red
spheres are within the volume while the green one is not and does not appear on
the projection.</p>

we'll only use the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)">perspective projection</a> (distant objects
appear smaller) and the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_projection_(geometry)">orthographic projection</a> which is a
parallel projection (distant objects have the same size as closer ones) as
illustrated on the image above. Until now (previous section), we have been

Suffice it to say they are standard matrices in the 3D world. Both suppose the

(0,0,1).</p>
<p>There exists a second form of the perpective matrix that might be easier to

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">Model and view matrices</a></h2>
<p>We are almost done with matrices. You may have guessed that the above matrix
requires the viewing volume to be in the z direction. We could design our 3D
scene such that all objects are withing this direction but it would not be very
convenient. So instead, we'll use a view matrix that will map the the world
space to camera space. This is pretty much as if we were orienting the camera
at a given position and look toward a given direction. In the meantime, we can
further refine the whole pipeline by providing a model matrix that will maps
the object's local coordinate space into world space. For example, this wil be
useful for rotating an object around its center. To sum up, we need:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">•</tt> <strong>Model matrix</strong> maps from an object's local coordinate space into world space</li>

<div class="section" id="building-cube">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">Building cube</a></h2>
<p>We need to define what we mean by a <em>cube</em> since there is not such thing as as
cube in OpenGL. A cube, when seen from the outside has 6 faces, each being a
square. We just saw that to render a square, we need two triangles. So, 6
faces, each of them being made of 2 triangles, we need 12 triangles.</p>
<p>How many vertices then ? 12 triangles ? 3 vertices per triangles ? 36 vertices
might be a reasonable answer but we can also notice that each vertex is part of
3 different faces actually, so instead we'll use no more than 8 vertices and
tell explicitly OpenGL what to draw with them:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
V = np.zeros(8, [(&quot;position&quot;, np.float32, 3)])
V[&quot;position&quot;] = [[ 1, 1, 1], [-1, 1, 1], [-1,-1, 1], [ 1,-1, 1],
                 [ 1,-1,-1], [ 1, 1,-1], [-1, 1,-1], [-1,-1,-1]]
</pre>
<p>These describes vertices of a cube cented on (0,0,0) that goes from (-1,-1,-1)
to (+1,+1,+1). Then we compute (mentally) what are the triangles for each face, i.e. we
describe triangles in terms of vertices index (relatively to the <tt class="docutils literal">V</tt> array we
just defined):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
I = [0,1,2, 0,2,3,  0,3,4, 0,4,5,  0,5,6, 0,6,1,
     1,6,7, 1,7,2,  7,4,3, 7,3,2,  4,7,6, 4,6,5]
</pre>
<p>We now need to upload these data to the GPU. Using gloo, the easiest way is to use a VertexBuffer for vertices data and an IndexBuffer for indices data:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
vertices = gloo.VertexBuffer(V)
indices = gloo.IndexBuffer(I)

<p>All the common matrix operations can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="scripts/transforms.py">transforms.py</a> script which define ortho, frustum and perspective
matrices as well as rotation, translation and scaling operations. We won't say
much more about these and you might want to read a book about geometry to

<p>We're now alsmost ready to render the whole scene but we need first to modify
the GLUT initialization a little bit. Previously, we used:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
glut.glutInitDisplayMode(glut.GLUT_DOUBLE | glut.GLUT_RGBA)
</pre>
<p>But now, we're explicity dealing with 3D, meaning some rendered triangles may
be behind some others and we don't want to handle rendering order to deal with
that. OpenGL will take care of that provided we declared we'll use a depth
buffer. We thus need to modify glut initialization as and to tell OpenGL to use
the depth buffer:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
glut.glutInitDisplayMode(glut.GLUT_DOUBLE | glut.GLUT_RGBA | glut.GLUT_DEPTH)
gl.glEnable(gl.GL_DEPTH_TEST)
</pre>
<p>and when clear the scene, we have to take care of clearing the depth buffer as well:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gl.glClear(gl.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | gl.GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)

<p>Now we'll discover why <strong>gloo</strong> is so useful. To add color per vertex to the
cube, we simply define the vertex structure as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
V = np.zeros(8, [(&quot;position&quot;, np.float32, 3),
                 (&quot;color&quot;,    np.float32, 4)])

                 [ 1,-1,-1], [ 1, 1,-1], [-1, 1,-1], [-1,-1,-1]]
V[&quot;color&quot;]    = [[0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1],
                 [1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1]]

<p>To outline the cube, we need to draw lines between couple of vertices on each
face. 4 lines for the back and front face and 2 lines for the top and bottom
faces. Why only 2 lines for top and bottom ? Because lines are shared between
the faces. So overall we need 12 lines and we need to compute the corresponding
indices (I did it for your):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
O = [0,1, 1,2, 2,3, 3,0,
     4,7, 7,6, 6,5, 5,4,

outline = IndexBuffer(O)
</pre>
<p>Then we draw the cube twice. One time using triangles and the indices index
buffer and one time using lines with the outline index buffer.  We need also to
add some OpenGL black magic to make things nice. It's not very important to
understand it at this point. The main it solves it to make sure line is &quot;above&quot;
the cube because we paint a line on a surface.</p>

<p>To have a lighted cube we need two things: a light source and surface
normals. Then we can apply light equation on each fragment depending on the
amount of light it receives. This is computed using the suface normal.</p>
<p>But we have a problem to solve. We need to compute normals for each surfaces,
which is rather easy but we need to give this information to the GPU via the
vertex structure. Since our vertices are shared between all the surfaces, it is
a problem. If you look at any vertex, you'll see it is shared between 3
distinct faces, each having a different normal. This means we'll have to
duplicate our vertices and to attach the right normal vector depending on the
face they belong. Hence, we now need 4 distinct vertices for each faces for a
total of 24 vertices.</p>
<p>The actual building of this new cube data is rather boring and I won't
detailed it here. The whole code is available from <a class="reference external" href="scripts/cube.py">cube.py</a>
that has a single <tt class="docutils literal">cube</tt> function that return cube vertices, faces and
outlines as 3 numpy arrays.</p>
<p>We can now define a light using a position and an intensity (color). This is
called a positional point light which send light in any direction (as opposed
for example to adirectional light such as a spotlight). There exist many
different light models and this one is probably the simplest. I won't explain
everything here (it would require a full tutorial only for this topic), but
here is the resulting fragment shader which is pretty self-explanatory:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform mat4 u_model;
uniform mat4 u_view;
uniform mat4 u_normal;

uniform vec3 u_light_intensity;
uniform vec3 u_light_position;

varying vec3 v_position;
varying vec3 v_normal;
varying vec4 v_color;

void main()
{
  // Calculate normal in world coordinates
  vec3 normal = normalize(u_normal * vec4(v_normal,1.0)).xyz;

  // Calculate the location of this fragment (pixel) in world coordinates
  vec3 position = vec3(u_view*u_model * vec4(v_position, 1));

  // Calculate the vector from this pixels surface to the light source
  vec3 surfaceToLight = u_light_position - position;

  // Calculate the cosine of the angle of incidence (brightness)
  float brightness = dot(normal, surfaceToLight) / (length(surfaceToLight) * length(normal));
  brightness = max(min(brightness,1.0),0.0);

  // Calculate final color of the pixel, based on:
  // 1. The angle of incidence: brightness
  // 2. The color/intensities of the light: light.intensities
  // 3. The texture and texture coord: texture(tex, fragTexCoord)

  gl_FragColor = v_color * brightness * vec4(u_light_intensity, 1);

<p><strong>An intro to modern OpenGL</strong> by Joe Groff.</p>
<p>OpenGL has been around a long time, and from reading all the accumulated layers
of documentation out there on the Internet, it's not always clear what parts
are historic and what parts are still useful and supported on modern graphics
hardware. It's about time for a new OpenGL <a class="reference external" href="http://duriansoftware.com/joe/An-intro-to-modern-OpenGL.-Table-of-Contents.html">introduction that</a> walks through the parts that are still relevant today.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming</strong> by Jason L. McKesson</p>
<p>This <a class="reference external" href="http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/">book</a> is intended to teach you how
to be a graphics programmer. It is not aimed at any particular graphics field;
it is designed to cover most of the basics of 3D rendering. So if you want to
be a game developer, a CAD program designer, do some computer visualization, or
any number of things, this book can still be an asset for you. This does not
mean that it covers everything there is about 3D graphics. Hardly. It tries to
provide a sound foundation for your further exploration in whatever field of 3D
graphics you are interested in.</p>

<p><strong>An Introduction to OpenGL Programming</strong></p>
<p>This <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8gjVbn8VBk&amp;feature=player_embedded">introduction</a>
provides an accelerated introduction to programming OpenGL, emphasizing the
most modern methods for using the library. In recent years, OpenGL has
undergone numerous updates, which have fundamentally changed how programmers
interact with the application programming interface (API) and the skills
required for being an effective OpenGL programmer. The most notable of these
changes, the introduction of shader-based rendering, has expanded to subsume
almost all functionality in OpenGL. This course is presented by Edward Angel of
the University of New Mexico and Dave Shreiner of ARM, Inc..</p>

<p><strong>OpenGL ES 2.0 documentation</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/opengles/2_X/">OpenGL ES 2.0</a> is defined relative to
the OpenGL 2.0 specification and emphasizes a programmable 3D graphics pipeline
with the ability to create shader and program objects and the ability to write
vertex and fragment shaders in the OpenGL ES Shading Language. Vispy is based
on OpenGL ES 2.0 because it give access to the programmable pipeline while
keeping overall complexity tractable.</p>
